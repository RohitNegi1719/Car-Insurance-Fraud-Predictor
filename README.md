# Insurance Fraud Predictor

## Overview
This project implements a web application for predicting insurance fraud using a machine learning model. Users can input their data through a form, and the application will predict whether the insurance claim is fraudulent or not.

## Dependencies
- streamlit
- pandas
- pickle

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the trained model file `Fraud_Predictor.pkl` and the Streamlit application script available.
2. Run the Streamlit application script using the command `streamlit run your_script.py`.
3. Access the application through the provided URL in your browser.
4. Fill in the required information in the form provided.
5. Click on the "Predict" button to see the prediction result.

## File Description
- `code.py`: Main script for the model.
- `gui.py`: Main script for the Streamlit application, containing the form for user input and prediction logic.
- `Fraud_Predictor.pkl`: Trained machine learning model saved as a pickle file.
